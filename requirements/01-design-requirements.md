# Design requirements

These are high-level requirements to translate into more low-level, functional requirements

## MVP

-   User can create account
-   User will be guided through onboarding process
    -   educate about product
    -   encourage retention
-   User will take survey for matching purposes
-   User can view other users and see match score
-   User can match with/move on from other users
-   Matching with another user will send notification to them
-   User can see who's requested them and either reciprocate or reject
-   User can chat with mutual matches
-   User can schedule a meetup with match
-   User can choose a time and place for meetup

## Stretch

-   User can specify matches should be restricted by geolocation
-   User can receive suggested activities based on interest and what's available locally

*Additional stretch ideas?*
